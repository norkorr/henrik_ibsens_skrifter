Henrik Ibsens skrifter (Henrik Ibsen's Writings) is to date the largest editorial project in Norway. The new edition will be a solid base for future Ibsen studies, translations and performances.

The edition is a complete historical-critical and commented edition of Henrik Ibsen's writings, printed and unprinted and comprises plays, poems, articles, lectures, letters, drafts and notes.

The collection of letters includes all known letters written by Ibsen, just under 2400 letters. We hope to include all of these in the NorKorr data set.
